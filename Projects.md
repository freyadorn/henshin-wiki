# SPELL

The [Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT)](http://wwwen.uni.lu/snt) at the University of Luxembourg uses Henshin for automatic translations of programming languages for satellite technology - a field that is highly relevant to Luxembourg-based SES, one of the world's leading satellite operators. Recently, SES has been working on developing the open-source-software SPELL (Satellite Procecure Execution Language and Library), a standardised satellite control language. The challenge is to convert all of the control procedures in existence that are being used in different programming languages over to SPELL. Henshin is used as underlying model transformation engine to automate this process and to guarantee a high-quality translation through automatic consistency testing.

For further information see the annual [SnT report 2011](http://www.uni.lu/content/download/52106/624943/version/1/file/SnT_AR2011_final_web.pdf), pages 14-15.

#  HenshinTGG and Multi-View Henshin Editor

The multi-view Henshin editor is an alternative graphical editor and based on the Henshin SDK using a multi view environment. HenshinTGG is a graphical multi-view editor dedicated for triple graph grammars with additional features for bidirectional model transformation and model synchronisation based on triple graph grammars (TGGs). Both editors are available via the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/de-tu-berlin-tfs/Henshin-Editor.

#  On-The-Fly Computing

The [research group databases and information systems of the University of Paderborn](http://is.uni-paderborn.de/) uses Henshin in the terms of the [collaborative research centre (CRC) "On-The-Fly Computing"](http://sfb901.uni-paderborn.de/). The goal of the CRC is to develop methods to automatically configure and execute IT services. One aspect of the automatic configuration is the matching of service requesters and providers. As a basis for the matching, the research group created a rich service description language (RSDL) to specify structural and behavioral characteristics of services. In particular, so called visual contracts describe the service's behavior. The RSDL workbench is a tool that allows to create RSDL specifications and Henshin was integrated to specify visual contracts.
