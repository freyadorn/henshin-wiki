The **Henshin Multi-View Editor** (development discontinued in 2015) was
an alternative to the integrated [Henshin Graphical
Editor](Graphical_Editor "wikilink"). It is based on the Muvitor
framework and maintained at [TU Berlin](http://www.tu-berlin.de/tfs) and
[Uni Luxembourg](http://wwwde.uni.lu/snt).

### Main differences

-   Multi-view: the editor provides a tree-view of the transformation
    system and graphical views for rules and graphs
-   Visual simulation: you can create a graph and apply your rules in
    the GUI
-   Rule view with separate LHS and RHS instead of an integrated view

### Availability

Multi-View Editor is is available at
[github](https://github.com/de-tu-berlin-tfs/Henshin-Editor/). The
repository contains the Henshin base plugins as well, which are extended
to fit to the HenshinTGG editor (a third kind of Henshin editor).

To try the Muvitor-based Henshin-Editor, it is suggested that you use
the plug-ins from the github repository. Currently no update site is
provided, so you need to do the following to use the editor:

1.  Import the plug-ins from the github repository into your main
    workspace
2.  Run \> Run as \> Eclipse application
